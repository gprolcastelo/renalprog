## Overview

`renalprog` is a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing kidney cancer (KIRC) progression using deep learning and pathway enrichment analysis. The package integrates **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** with **differential expression analysis** and **gene set enrichment** to model cancer progression trajectories.

### Scientific Context

Cancer progression is a complex, dynamic process involving multiple molecular alterations across time. Traditional static analyses fail to capture the temporal dynamics of tumor evolution. `renalprog` addresses this challenge by:

1. **Learning latent representations** of gene expression data using deep generative models (VAEs)
2. **Generating synthetic trajectories** between cancer stages in latent space
3. **Identifying enriched biological pathways** along progression trajectories
4. **Classifying cancer stages** using interpretable machine learning

This approach enables researchers to:

- Identify key biological pathways driving cancer progression
- Predict patient outcomes based on molecular profiles
- Understand the temporal dynamics of tumor evolution
